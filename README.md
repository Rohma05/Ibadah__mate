# Ibadah__mate
Ibadaah Mate is a mobile app designed to help users stay consistent with their daily acts of worship. It allows users to track prayers, build positive spiritual habits, and monitor progress in a simple and user-friendly way. This project was built as part of my journey in learning mobile app development.
